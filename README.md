<h1>University Codes</h1>
<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>This is where I stash all the coding assignments and classwork from my university courses. If you're looking for examples or need a hand with your own projects, you're in luck!</p>
<p>Inside, you'll find a bunch of projects covering different topics and using various programming languages. Feel free to take a peek, borrow some code if you need it, or even contribute your own solutions!</p>
<p>Just a heads up, it's still a work in progress, so expect more goodies to be added over time!</p>
<p>Happy coding and best of luck with your studies! ðŸ“šðŸ’»</p>
